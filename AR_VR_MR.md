# **Application of AI in data security**
Data security focus on to preventing intrusions and detecting intrusions from any 
adversaries. AI is an valuable tool for protecting data currently. AI can detect 
unauthorized activity within networks, it analyze malicious software that can lead to 
the data insecure, it can cover or patch vulnerabilities in a company’s and it can detect 
and prevent insider threats (is any action that can disrupt or adversely affect a 
system). With Ai powered data security tools, companies can quickly patch 
vulnerabilities faster, prevent data breaches and identify intrusions. Also it allows for 
automated monitoring of system operations to prevent anonymous and malware 
infections as well as for real time cybersecurity alerting. Further more Ai driven 
analytics can also provide insights on how to respond to potential threats or breaches 
more efficiently means knowing about adversaries allows you to know their tactics, 
techniques and procedure in order to prepare a response strategy to secure your data.
-                                    Real world examples of Ai
⚫ Email spam filters
⚫ Threat identification
⚫ AI-powered biometrics technology
⚫ Credit card fraud detection and risk reduction
⚫ Detecting zero-day malware (is a computer software vulnerability)
⚫ Cloud security automation
⚫ Securing authentication
Advantage and disadvantage of Ai in data security
⚫ Advantage, Ai is being used to help improve data security efforts across the globe. 
Ai algorithms can detect and prevent potential security threats, analyze large 
datasets and create more secure networks. Ai can also be used to alert malicious 
activity and suspicious behavior.
⚫ Disadvantage, Ai technology has some disadvantage that prevent it form being 
mainstream security tool. The major disadvantage or limitation is hackers also 
use Ai to improve and enhance their malicious software and to break in to 
systems. AI-based malware can be extremely dangerous because it can develop 
more advanced attacks by learning from existing Ai tools. 
Ai in travel and transport
Ai has been transforming the way we travel from place to place by enhancing many 
aspects of transportation, from making smart route decision, enhancing safety on 
roads, providing real time traffic light management. Additionally Ai can be used to 
monitor driver behavior and identify unsafe practices or risks. Also Ai can assist in 
suggesting better routes for travelers in order to avoid crowded routes and risks. 
Furthermore, Ai is being utilized to develop autonomous vehicles(self driving car) 
that enable humans to get around without any human assistance.
Real world examples
⚫ Self-driving cars
⚫ Traffic detection
⚫ Parking management
⚫ Road condition monitoring
⚫ Autonomous planes (not existing but it will) 
⚫ Drone taxis
Advantage and disadvantage of Ai in transport
⚫ Advantage, Increasing AI-powered systems in transport will reduced labour 
costs.It has also uses to prevent traffic accidents, Also traffic management 
systems are more efficiently done with AI-powered system.it also use for data 
analytics to upgrade transportation safety and overall system.
⚫ Disadvantage, The disadvantages of Ai as he intervene in to transportation, the 
first one it take a lot of jobs from peoples because there are many peoples which 
work on that. The second and which related to the first topic is security issue no 
matter how good security there is always a chance for intrusion or attacks from 
attackers and they can make a huge damage.
